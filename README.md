# Anatomy Chat: Interactive Anatomical Learning and Modeling Platform

## About the Project

Anatomy Chat is a modern web application that transforms human anatomy from static images or text-based documents into an interactive experience. This platform models each organ as "intelligent entities" that have their own personality, can share information, and respond to specific questions from the user's perspective.

The application is built on a multi-layered "Persona" system to appeal to a wide range of users, from medical students to curious children. Users can chat with their chosen organ with the seriousness of a doctor, the excitement of a curious student, or the imagination of a child.

## Key Features

### 1. Persona-Based AI Interaction
The application operates the artificial intelligence in three core narrative modes:
- **Doctor Mode:** Uses an academic language proficient in technical terminology, providing clinical findings and pathological details.
- **Curious Mode:** Focuses on the functional features and interesting facts of the organ, blending science with everyday language.
- **Child Mode:** An educational and entertaining language that explains the organ's duty in the body through a fairytale-like narrative using metaphors.

### 2. Advanced Session Management (Multi-Session)
Users can start multiple chat sessions for each organ:
- Chats are automatically named based on the first message.
- Fast switching between sessions is supported.
- Session titles can be manually renamed or unnecessary sessions can be deleted.

### 3. Modern and Focused UI Architecture
- **ChatGPT Architecture:** Features a fixed navigation panel on the left and a fluid, centered message area on the right.
- **Smart Scroll:** Automatic scrolling stops when the user scrolls up to read past messages; it resumes once the user returns to the bottom.
- **Dark Mode Optimization:** A "Deep Dark" design language has been adopted for night study, providing high contrast without eye strain.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **State Management:** Zustand (Persisted via browser storage)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Vanilla CSS (Custom UI Components)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Icon Set:** Lucide React
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

## Installation Guide

### Requirements
- Node.js (v18+) and npm/yarn or
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Standard Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local directory:
   ```bash
   git clone [repo-url]
   cd anatomy-chat
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Installation with Docker (Recommended)
To run the application without dealing with dependencies:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will compile, optimize, and make the application available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

You can configure the following by clicking the "Model Settings" button in the application interface:
- **API Provider:** OpenRouter compatible providers such as OpenAI, Claude, Groq, or Ollama.
- **Model Selection:** The AI model to be used (e.g., gpt-4, claude-3-opus).
- **API Key:** The secure key obtained from your provider.
- **Parameters:** Temperature and Max Tokens settings.

## Project Structure
