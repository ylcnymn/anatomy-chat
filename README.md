**Anatomy Chat** is a high-fidelity, interactive educational platform designed to demonstrate the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in specialized domain modeling. It transforms static anatomical data into a dynamic, multi-modal learning experience where every organ is an "intelligent agent" with its own specific knowledge base, persona, and clinical context.

## 🚀 The Vision: Beyond Simple Chatbots

This project is not just a chat interface; it is an exploration of **Architectural AI Orchestration**. It demonstrates how to:
1.  **Structure Complex Ontologies:** Managing hierarchical anatomical systems (Nervous, Digestive, etc.) in a JSON-driven data layer.
2.  **Impersonate Specialized Personas:** Using advanced prompt engineering to switch between academic (Doctor), educational (Curious), and metaphorical (Child) reasoning.
3.  **State-Persistent Experience:** Leveraging local storage and Zustand to maintain complex session states without a heavy backend.

## ✨ Key Architectural Features

### 1. Persona-Driven LLM Framework
The core innovation lies in the **dynamic system prompt generation**. Depending on the selected mode, the LLM adjusts its:
-   **Vocabulary Depth:** From Latin medical terms to simple metaphors.
-   **Reasoning Style:** Clinical diagnosis vs. functional curiosity.
-   **Tone:** Empathetic, authoritative, or playful.

### 2. Hierarchical Anatomical Navigator (The "Body Map")
A recursive, tree-based navigation system that allows users to drill down from major body systems to specific organic structures (e.g., *Digestive System -> Intestines -> Small Intestine -> Duodenum*).

### 3. Professional Research-Grade UI/UX
-   **Obsidian Dark Aesthetic:** Designed for high focus and reduced eye strain.
-   **Markdown & GFM Support:** Real-time rendering of structured data, including professional tables, zebra-striped for readability.
-   **Smart-Stream Architecture:** Low-latency streaming responses with auto-scroll management for a smooth reading experience.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- An API Key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or OpenAI.

### Standard Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ylcnymn/anatomy-chat.git
cd anatomy-chat
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Docker Setup (One-Click)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🧪 How It Works (The Method)

The application follows a **"Configuration-First"** approach. 
1. The user provides an API key and selects a model via the **Settings Modal**.
2. When an organ is selected, the application injects the specific anatomical definition and the selected persona's behavioral guidelines into the **LLM System Prompt**.
3. Conversations are managed in **Sessions**, allowing for multi-threaded learning paths per organ.
